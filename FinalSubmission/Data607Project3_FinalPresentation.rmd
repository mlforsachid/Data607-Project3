1. > Approach

All the credit goes to the team work for the success of this project. We went through typical team forming, storming and norming phases while we marched towards accomplishing common goals towards the project submission.

* Team Forming : - While we were late in forming a team, a common force of accomplishing the project achievement brought us all together. Thanks to Sabrina for helping us connecting together.

* Team Storming : - 
    + Free Rider : Fortunately we didn't have that issue
    + Loss of resources : We lost two team members in the process
    + Conflict amongst team members : Eveyone had unique perspective. This was inevitable

* Team Norming : -
    + Results in common direction : All of us had a common goal in mind to accomplish the project success
    + More ideas are shared : We were amazed with how much more we can achive while working together
    + Increased efficiency : Everyone put their best foot forward resulting into increased efficiency
    + Accountability of weak areas : Everyone realized that one member's weakness can be other's strength.

7. > Lessons learned and possible enhancements

Following are the lesson leanred while working on this project

* Team rocks. You can always deliver more when collaborate
* Team communication is a key. Need to leverage online tools like Video Conferencing, Slack channel, Emails for being connected
* Respecting diverse perspective : Best results can be acheved when diverse perspective is valued and respected
* Data is the most critical asset for any data anaysis work
* More time is spent in data preparation work (70%) and lesser time on Data Analysitcs work (30%)
* Time difference challenge. Need to plan conferences suiting everyone's need


Future Enhancements

* Gathering more data. Multiple data sources, adding more dimensions.
* Adding multidimensional analytics with added dimensions like Geo, Regions and Countires
* Creating comparison charts for Data Science skillsets between various job sites
* Identify hot regions where Data Science skills are predominant
* Identify correlation between educational institutions and software companies where Data Science skills are predominant
